# LeetCode Note
Welcome to my LeetCode repository! This repository is dedicated to storing my solutions and notes for problems on LeetCode. The purpose of this repository is to serve as a reference for me while I am practicing for coding interviews.

## How to Use
Each problem is represented by a python file with the file name as the problem number in Leetcode. For example, the solution for Leetcode problem number 153 can be found in `153.py`
If you are also using this repository to prepare for coding interviews or just want to see how I solved a specific problem, you can look at the problem on Leetcode and find the problem number. Then, you can find the solution in the corresponding file in this repository.

If you have a better solution or find a mistake in my solution, please feel free to open a pull request.

Happy interview prep!
